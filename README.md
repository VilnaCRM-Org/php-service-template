## Possibilities
- Modern PHP stack for services: [API Platform 3](https://api-platform.com/), PHP 8, [Symfony 6](https://symfony.com/)
- [Hexagonal Architecture, DDD & CQRS in PHP](https://github.com/CodelyTV/php-ddd-example)
- Built-in docker environment and convenient `make` cli command
- A lot of CI checks to ensure the highest code quality that can be ([Psalm](https://psalm.dev/), [PHPInsights](https://phpinsights.com/), Security checks, Code style fixer)
- Configured testing tools: [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/), [Behat](https://docs.behat.org/)
- Much more!

## Why you might need it
Many PHP developers need to create new projects from scratch and spend a lot of time. 

We decided to simplify this exhausting process and create a public template for modern PHP applications. This template is used for all our microservices in VilnaCRM.

## Documentation
Start reading at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/wiki). If you're having trouble, head for [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/wiki/Troubleshooting) as it's frequently updated.

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org) installed.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vilnacrm), and before you ask a question, [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Tests
[Tests](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/php-service-template/tree/main/tests/) use PHPUnit 9 and [Behat](https://github.com/Behat/Behat).
